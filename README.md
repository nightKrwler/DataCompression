# DataCompression
1. 9 combinations of 4 different data compression algorithms namely, Run Length Encoding, Burrows Wheeler Transform, Huffman Encoding and LZ77 have been implemented on 4 data sets.
2. Huffman encoding followed by LZ77 is collectively called the Deflate algorithm. 
3. These data sets have varying levels of repetitive sequences in them.
4. The methodology and results are provided in the final report.
