Poems
I miss you in the morning;
I miss you late at night.
Just to think about you
Is my joy and my delight.
I can't wait to see you;
Please hurry and come back.
You always make me happy;
You have that special knack!


Life gets faster every day,
No time to think, no time to play.
Hurry, chaos, lots of stress,
Tension leads to sleeplessness.
When will all this madness cease?
Where is free time? Where is peace?
I'm running, doing, till I drop.
Give me buttons: Pause, Mute, STOP!


I'm thinking of you
With joy and pleasure,
Remembering times
I'll always treasure.


When I think of you,
My heart is light;
You're a special person,
A sheer delight.


Thoughts of you cheer me up
Whenever I'm blue;
I'm always happy
When I think of you.


I think of you often,
In the fondest way;
I cherish you more
Than I ever could say.


When the gloomy gray sky turns to clear azure blue,
And the snow disappears from the ground,
When the birds start to sing, and our moods start to lift,
Then we know Spring is coming around.


When the first flower bulbs poke their heads toward the sun,
Golden daffodils, hyacinths, too;
When the brown grass turns green, and the wildflowers bloom,
Then sweet Spring makes its showy debut.


Once again we awake from cold winter's pale dream,
As our minds and our bodies revive;
We rejoice and delight in spring's colorful sight;
Each new spring makes us glad we're alive!


Sunshine beaming golden heat
For lots of fun outdoors;
Vacations, for a sweet retreat
To mountains, plains and shores.


Kids in constant summer motion,
Free from teacher's rule,
Head to toe in suntan lotion,
At the beach or pool.


Inflatable rafts on which to float,
Camping and fishing gear,
Rowing or sailing or waterski boat,
Tell us summer's here.


Things we can't do the rest of the year
Are summer's special treasures;
Oh summer, summer, linger long,
And give us all your pleasures!


Healing summer heat
That comforts every bone;
Juicy summer fruits,
A frosty ice cream cone.


Aroma of sizzling meat
Grilling on the barbecue,
Green lawns and summer flowers,
A gazillion fun things to do.


Summer shorts and swimsuits,
Arms and legs are bare;
Summer's sweet delights
Are welcome everywhere!


Summer's getting drowsy now;
Soon she will be dozing;
Flowers are folding up their heads,
Another season's closing.


Fall is waiting in the wings,
Impatient to get going,
He has a lot of work to do,
Before it's time for snowing.


"I have to paint the leaves," he says,
"In shades of red and gold,
And send the geese along their way
Before it gets too cold.


"I'll ripen pumpkins on the vine,
For sweet Thanksgiving pies,
And plump the apples on the trees
To make cider that satisfies.


"Sunshiny days will be shorter now;
I'll add a cool, crisp breeze;
For this relief from summer heat,
I make no apologies.


"I have just one more thing to do;
My work is almost done;
I'll turn the leaves to crunchy piles,
So kids can have fall fun!

Poems
I miss you in the morning;
I miss you late at night.
Just to think about you
Is my joy and my delight.
I can't wait to see you;
Please hurry and come back.
You always make me happy;
You have that special knack!


Life gets faster every day,
No time to think, no time to play.
Hurry, chaos, lots of stress,
Tension leads to sleeplessness.
When will all this madness cease?
Where is free time? Where is peace?
I'm running, doing, till I drop.
Give me buttons: Pause, Mute, STOP!


I'm thinking of you
With joy and pleasure,
Remembering times
I'll always treasure.


When I think of you,
My heart is light;
You're a special person,
A sheer delight.


Thoughts of you cheer me up
Whenever I'm blue;
I'm always happy
When I think of you.


I think of you often,
In the fondest way;
I cherish you more
Than I ever could say.


When the gloomy gray sky turns to clear azure blue,
And the snow disappears from the ground,
When the birds start to sing, and our moods start to lift,
Then we know Spring is coming around.


When the first flower bulbs poke their heads toward the sun,
Golden daffodils, hyacinths, too;
When the brown grass turns green, and the wildflowers bloom,
Then sweet Spring makes its showy debut.


Once again we awake from cold winter's pale dream,
As our minds and our bodies revive;
We rejoice and delight in spring's colorful sight;
Each new spring makes us glad we're alive!


Sunshine beaming golden heat
For lots of fun outdoors;
Vacations, for a sweet retreat
To mountains, plains and shores.


Kids in constant summer motion,
Free from teacher's rule,
Head to toe in suntan lotion,
At the beach or pool.


Inflatable rafts on which to float,
Camping and fishing gear,
Rowing or sailing or waterski boat,
Tell us summer's here.


Things we can't do the rest of the year
Are summer's special treasures;
Oh summer, summer, linger long,
And give us all your pleasures!


Healing summer heat
That comforts every bone;
Juicy summer fruits,
A frosty ice cream cone.


Aroma of sizzling meat
Grilling on the barbecue,
Green lawns and summer flowers,
A gazillion fun things to do.


Summer shorts and swimsuits,
Arms and legs are bare;
Summer's sweet delights
Are welcome everywhere!


Summer's getting drowsy now;
Soon she will be dozing;
Flowers are folding up their heads,
Another season's closing.


Fall is waiting in the wings,
Impatient to get going,
He has a lot of work to do,
Before it's time for snowing.


"I have to paint the leaves," he says,
"In shades of red and gold,
And send the geese along their way
Before it gets too cold.


"I'll ripen pumpkins on the vine,
For sweet Thanksgiving pies,
And plump the apples on the trees
To make cider that satisfies.


"Sunshiny days will be shorter now;
I'll add a cool, crisp breeze;
For this relief from summer heat,
I make no apologies.


"I have just one more thing to do;
My work is almost done;
I'll turn the leaves to crunchy piles,
So kids can have fall fun!

Made in a proper copper coffee pot
I may be off my dot
But I want a cup of coffee
From a proper coffee pot.
Tin coffee pots and iron coffee pots
They're no use to me -
If I can't have a proper cup of coffee
In a proper copper coffee pot
I'll have a cup of tea.

And harder still to do.

At a minute or two to two today

In the fondest way;
I cherish you more
Than I ever could say.


When the gloomy gray sky turns to clear azure blue,
And the snow disappears from the ground,
When the birds start to sing, and our moods start to lift,
Then we know Spring is coming around.


When the first flower bulbs poke their heads toward the sun,
Golden daffodils, hyacinths, too;
When the brown grass turns green, and the wildflowers bloom,
Then sweet Spring makes its showy debut.


Once again we awake from cold winter's pale dream,
As our minds and our bodies revive;
We rejoice and delight in spring's colorful sight;
Each new spring makes us glad we're alive!


Sunshine beaming golden heat
For lots of fun outdoors;
Vacations, for a sweet retreat
To mountains, plains and shores.


Kids in constant summer motion,
Free from teacher's rule,
Head to toe in suntan lotion,
At the beach or pool.


Inflatable rafts on which to float,
Camping and fishing gear,
Rowing or sailing or waterski boat,
Tell us summer's here.


Things we can't do the rest of the year
Are summer's special treasures;
Oh summer, summer, linger long,
And give us all your pleasures!


Healing summer heat
That comforts every bone;
Juicy summer fruits,
A frosty ice cream cone.


Aroma of sizzling meat
Grilling on the barbecue,
Green lawns and summer flowers,
A gazillion fun things to do.


Summer shorts and swimsuits,
Arms and legs are bare;
Summer's sweet delights
Are welcome everywhere!


Summer's getting drowsy now;
Soon she will be dozing;
Flowers are folding up their heads,
Another season's closing.


Fall is waiting in the wings,
Impatient to get going,
He has a lot of work to do,
Before it's time for snowing.


"I have to paint the leaves," he says,
"In shades of red and gold,
And send the geese along their way
Before it gets too cold.


"I'll ripen pumpkins on the vine,
For sweet Thanksgiving pies,
And plump the apples on the trees
To make cider that satisfies.


"Sunshiny days will be shorter now;
I'll add a cool, crisp breeze;
For this relief from summer heat,
I make no apologies.


"I have just one more thing to do;
My work is almost done;
I'll turn the leaves to crunchy piles,
So kids can have fall fun!
